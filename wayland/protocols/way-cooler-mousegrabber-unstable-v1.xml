    <description summary="manipulate the compositor's cursor">
      This interface allows clients to manipulate the compositor's cursor
      position on the screen.

      The intended use case of this is to re-implement AwesomeWM's original
      "keygrabber" Lua interface.

        Attempts to grab the mouse from the compositor.

        Only one client can grab the mouse at a time. Attempts to grab while
        another client is already grabbing is a protocol error.
